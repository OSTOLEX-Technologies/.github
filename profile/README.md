# OSTOLEX

OSTOLEX is a development studio from Kharkiv, Ukraine. We mostly build blockchain games, but we are not limited to them only

Started on NEAR Hack in Kyiv in December 2021 we fell in love with NEAR and its community. We have a huge passion for building projects and have participated in numerous hackathons.

Our magnum opus right now is the Castledice. It's a turn-based board strategy game, early alfa soon. 

Another thing we started working on is building a gaming ecosystem on the Blockchain Operating System.

We are working both on various different games, such as [Laser Chess](https://near.social/#/let45fc.near/widget/LaserChess3D), and a [Gamedev Framework](https://near.org/ostolex.near/widget/Gamedev).
