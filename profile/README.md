# OSTOLEX

OSTOLEX is a gamedev studio from Kharkiv, Ukraine.

Started on NEAR Hack in Kyiv in December 2021 we fell in love with NEAR and its community. We have a huge passion for building projects and have participated in numerous hackathons.

Our magnum opus right now is the [Hockey Club Manager](http://hockeyclubmanager.com/). It's a sports management simulation game on which we are working for more than a year now and the testnet realize will be in a couple of months.

Another thing we started working on is building a gaming ecosystem on near.social.

We are working both on various different games, such as [Laser Chess](https://near.social/#/let45fc.near/widget/LaserChess3D). And a gaming framework, that would consist of widgets (for example: [User matcher widget](https://near.social/#/let45fc.near/widget/UsersMatcher), [Dice widget](https://near.social/#/ostolex.near/widget/DiceWidget), [Leaderboard widget](https://near.social/#/ostolex.near/widget/LeaderBoardWidget)).
